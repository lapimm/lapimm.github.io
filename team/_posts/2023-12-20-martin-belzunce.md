Electronic engineer and scientist with a PhD in image processing, focused on both fundamental research and the translational application of novel medical image processing methods. Experience includes designing and implementing a wide range of image processing and reconstruction algorithms in PET and SPECT imaging. Additionally, involved in the development of radiation detectors for nuclear medicine and other medical devices. Recent work has centered on the translational aspects of medical image processing, initially applying novel PET image reconstruction techniques to study brain disorders, followed by the application of image processing and deep learning methods for CT and MRI imaging in musculoskeletal applications.
