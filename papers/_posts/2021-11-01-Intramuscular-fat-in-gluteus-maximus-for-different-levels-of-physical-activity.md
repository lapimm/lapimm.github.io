# Abstract
We aimed to determine if gluteus maximus (GMAX) fat infiltration is associated with different levels of physical activity. Identifying and quantifying differences in the intramuscular fat content of GMAX in subjects with different levels of physical activity can provide a new tool to evaluate hip muscles health. This was a cross-sectional study involving seventy subjects that underwent Dixon MRI of the pelvis. The individuals were divided into four groups by levels of physical activity, from low to high: inactive patients due to hip pain; and low, medium and high physical activity groups of healthy subjects (HS) based on hours of exercise per week. We estimated the GMAX intramuscular fat content for each subject using automated measurements of fat fraction (FF) from Dixon images. The GMAX volume and lean volume were also measured and normalized by lean body mass. The effects of body mass index (BMI) and age were included in the statistical analysis. The patient group had a significantly higher FF than the three groups of HS (median values of 26.2%, 17.8%, 16.7% and 13.7% respectively, p < 0.001). The normalized lean volume was significantly larger in the high activity group compared to all the other groups (p < 0.001, p = 0.002 and p = 0.02). Employing a hierarchical linear regression analysis, we found that hip pain, low physical activity, female gender and high BMI were statistically significant predictors of increased GMAX fat infiltration.
