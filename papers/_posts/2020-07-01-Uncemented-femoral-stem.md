# Abstract

In total hip arthroplasty (THA), accurate positioning of components is important for the functionality and long life of the implant. Femoral component version has been underinvestigated when compared with the acetabular cup. Accurate prediction of the femoral version on the preoperative plan is particularly important because a well-fitting uncemented stem will, by definition, press-fit into a version that is dictated by the anatomy of the proximal femur. A better understanding of this has recently become an unmet need because of the increased use of uncemented stems and of preoperative image-based planning. We present the first, three-dimensional (3D) comparison between the planned and achieved orientation and position of the femoral components in THA. We propose a comparison method that uses the 3D models of a, computed tomography-generated (CT-generated), preoperative plan and a postoperative CT to obtain the discrepancy in the six possible degrees of freedom. We ran a prospective study (level 2 evidence) of 30 patients undergoing uncemented THA to quantify the discrepancy between planned and achieved femoral stem orientation and position. The discrepancy was low for femoral stem vertical position and leg length, and varus-valgus and anterior-posterior orientation. The discrepancy was higher for femoral version with a mean (±SD) of −1.5 ± 7.8 deg. Surgeons should be aware of the variability of the eventual position of uncemented stems in THA and acknowledge the risk of achieving a less-than-optimal femoral version, different from the preoperative 3D CT plan.
