Hendrik was an MSTP (Medical Scientist Training Program) student in the [Biophysics program][1] at the [University of Chicago][2] and a medical student in the [Pritzker School of Medicine][3]. He was jointly advised by [Tobin Sosnick][4], and studied stress-induced biomolecular condensation of mRNAs and proteins from the biophysical behavior of individual transcripts to whole-transcriptome regulatory phenomena. He successfully defended his Ph.D. dissertation in July 2023, and is now continuing his medical studies.
