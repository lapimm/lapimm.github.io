    <em>In this figure, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG brain images are shown for two different reconstruction
    methods: Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) algorithm, the standard PET image reconstruction method,
    and MR-Assisted MAP-EM reconstruction. The animation shows: 1) the same slice converging to a solution
    during the reconstruction process, 2) all the slices for the final reconstructed image, and 3)
    rotating Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs).</em>
