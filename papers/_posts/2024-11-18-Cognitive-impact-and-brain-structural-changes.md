# Abstract
## Objective
Long COVID is a condition characterised by persistent symptoms after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, with neurological manifestations being particularly frequent. Existing research suggests that long COVID patients not only report cognitive symptoms but also exhibit measurable cognitive impairment. Neuroimaging studies have identified structural alterations in brain regions linked to cognitive functions. However, most of these studies have focused on patients within months of their initial infection. This study aims to explore the longer-term cognitive effects and brain structural changes in long COVID patients, approximately two years post-infection, in a cohort from San Martín, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

## Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 137 participants: 109 with long COVID symptoms and 28 healthy controls. The participants underwent an initial clinical assessment, completed a structured questionnaire and standardised scales, underwent a cognitive assessment, and had a brain MRI scan. Structural MRI images were processed via FreeSurfer and FSL to obtain volumetric measures for subcortical and cortical regions, along with regional cortical thickness. Differences between groups for these variables were analysed using ANCOVA, with permutation tests applied to correct for multiple comparisons.

## Results
Long COVID patients reported persistent cognitive symptoms such as memory problems and brain fog, with higher levels of fatigue and reduced quality of life compared to controls. Despite subjective cognitive complaints, cognitive tests did not reveal significant differences between groups, except for the TMT-A (p = 0.05). MRI analysis revealed decreased volume in the cerebellum (p = 0.03), lingual gyrus (p = 0.04), and inferior parietal regions (p = 0.03), and reduced cortical thickness in several areas, including the left and right postcentral gyri (p = 0.02, p = 0.03) and precuneus (p = 0.01, p = 0.02).

## Conclusions
This study highlights the enduring impact of long COVID on quality of life and physical activity, with specific brain structural changes identified two years post-infection. Although cognitive tests did not show clear impairment, the observed brain atrophy and significant reduction in quality of life emphasize the need for comprehensive interventions and further longitudinal studies to understand the long-term effects of long COVID on cognition and brain health.
