Congratulations to [Kyle] for winning the Grier Prize (for Innovative Research in the Biophysical Sciences) for his project, “How immune cells transduce fever.” The purpose of the prize is to support UChicago Biophysics students who seek to develop new areas of research that may involve high risk or require development of new technology.
