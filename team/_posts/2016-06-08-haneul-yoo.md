Haneul received her Ph.D. in 2021 from the [Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics][1] graduate program at the [University of Chicago][2]. She joined the Drummond lab in June 2016. 

For her [PhD thesis][3], Haneul studied how molecular chaperones remodel biomolecular condensates using biochemistry, biophysics, and quantitative models. Her work was supported by the NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award via the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). 

Haneul was a graduate student advisor for the UChicago iGEM team, [GeneHackers][4]. If you are a first-year graduate student, she recommends reading the [BSD Student Mentor guide][5].
