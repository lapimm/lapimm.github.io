I'm a Biomedical Engineer graduated from the Universidad Nacional of Entre Rios. In the 2023, I started a PhD under the direction of Dr Martin Belzunce with a CONICET fellowship. My research topic focuses on the study of the degree of brain functional disconnection in neurodegenerative diseases based on correlation length
