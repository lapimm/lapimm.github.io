I’m an electronic engineer and a scientist with a PhD in image processing interested in the basic science and translational application of novel medical image processing methods. Over the years, I have designed and implemented a wide range of image processing and image reconstruction algorithms in the field of PET and SPECT image reconstruction. Also, I have been involved in the design of radiation detectors for nuclear medicine and other medical devices. In the last years, I have focused on the translational aspects of medical image processing, first in the application of novel PET image reconstruction to study brain disorders and then in the application of image processing and deep learning methods for CT and MRI imaging in musculoskeletal applications
