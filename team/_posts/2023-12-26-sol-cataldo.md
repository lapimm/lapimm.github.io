I'm an advanced student of the Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering at the Universidad Nacional de San Martin. I’m currently working with Martin Belzunce on an EVC-CIN  scholarship at the Centro Universitario de Imagenes Médicas (CEUNIM), a medical facility affiliated with my university. My project involves developing a predictor for the neurocognitive impact of long COVID. Additionally I’m  working with PET and MRI imaging and I’m developing an open pipeline for 18F FDG PET quantification
