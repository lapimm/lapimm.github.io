Sammy did her graduate work in the [Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology][1] graduate program at the [University of Chicago][2]. She joined the Drummond lab in July 2018, and graduted with her PhD in June 2023. 

Sammy recevied her B.S. in  Molecular Biology in 2016 from [Loyola University Chicago]. Her undergraduate work explored [microbial community diversity] in wetlands inundated with invasive species. 

Sammy's research utilized genetics, biochemistry, and computational biology to address the fundamental question: how do cells across the tree of life sense and respond to stress? Specifically, her currernt work explores stress-induced protein condensation as a conserved, adaptive, and tuned response to features of the cellular and organismal environment. Sammy's graduate work was supported by the NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) F31 via the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).

In her free time, Sammy was an assistant editor at the [Illinois Science Council blog], and she watches a lot of [soccer].
