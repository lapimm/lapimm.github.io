# Abstract 

Heat stress triggers a specific set of proteins in budding yeast to form solid-like
biomolecular condensates, which are dispersed by molecular chaperones.
Here, we describe a protocol to study the kinetics of chaperone-facilitated
condensate dispersal using biochemical reconstitution and fluorescence anisotropy. Although the current protocol is tailored to study heat-induced condensates of poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1), the protocol can be modified to
study any protein which shows differential substrate binding activity upon
condensation. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to
Yoo et al. (2022).
